# Diabetes-Prediction-Data-Intensive-App
The following dataset contains information useful for predicting the presence or not of diabetes. This information is collected by 2000 patients. The goal of the project is to be able to create a classification model that can predict a binary discrete variable: 0 in case the person is not diabetic, 1 if the person is diabetic.
